  {
    term: "APR",
    simpleExplanation:
      "APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It tells you how much extra money you pay back in one full year when you borrow money. For example, if you borrow ₹1,000 at 12% APR, you pay back ₹1,120 at the end of the year.",

  },
  {
    term: "interest rate",
    simpleExplanation:

  },
  {
    term: "crop insurance",
    simpleExplanation:

  },
  {
    term: "beneficiary",
    simpleExplanation:

  },
  {
    term: "khasra number",
    simpleExplanation:
      "Khasra number is a special number given to your piece of agricultural land by the government. It is like a house number but for your farm. You find it on your land records (khatauni).",

  },
  {
    term: "income certificate",
    simpleExplanation:

    example: "Certificate saying your annual income is ₹80,000",
  },
  {
    term: "SHG",
    simpleExplanation:
      "SHG stands for Self-Help Group. It is a group of 10 to 20 people — usually women — from the same village who save money together every month and give small loans to each other when needed.",

  },
  {
    term: "bank passbook",
    simpleExplanation:
